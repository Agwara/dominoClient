Firstly, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.
My name is Agwara Nnaemeka, I'm from Abia State, Nigeria. I'm currently pursuing
a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the Federal University Of 
Technology, Owerri.
I stubmbled upon web programming in January 2019 and ever since then, I've fallen
in love with it and I'm interested in expanding my career in Software Engineering 
after my program in school. So far, I have worked with JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, 
React.js, Node.js, Git/Github, Bootstrap, JSON, API.
Besides my work and academic, I am extremely passionate about playing Chess, which is a great 
mental torture for me.
