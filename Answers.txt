1 Primarily, I will create multiple instances of my server and setup an Apache server as load
  balancer between them to reduce the load on a single server significantly. This will handle the use case well bacause
  Apache server was designed to handle concurrent request using multithreading unlike a single
  threaded server.

2. I will consider using third party authentication or identity management sytems like AuthO/firebase.
   In which case I'll have to use their SDK on the front-end, authenticate users and extract the unique
   token returned from the third party service for storage on my server

3. Session storage is used for only one session, that is data is deleted when the tab or browser closes
